HOOKS FIXED: This edit should trigger the pre/post hooks and show inline diff!

TEST AFTER REBASE: This line should trigger the inline diff automatically!

RESTART COMPLETE: Testing hooks after Neovim restart!

MANUAL HOOK TEST: Testing with manual hook execution!

DEBUG HOOK TEST: Testing if Claude Code calls the hook script!

DEBUG LOGGING: Testing with detailed debug logging!

NOTIFICATION TEST: Testing with enhanced notifications after restart!

CLEAR LOG TEST: Testing after clearing debug log!

ESCAPE FIX: Testing with fixed escape sequence in settings.json!

SCOPE FIX: Testing with fixed baseline_ref scope!
