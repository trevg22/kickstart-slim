Fresh restart - testing stash browsing with updated recovery logic!

Now baseline exists - this should work properly!

Testing with debug logs to see what's happening in the hooks.

After reloading hooks module - this should create debug logs!

Testing after manual baseline creation - this should work now!

After manually initializing stash session - test the browsing commands!

Testing unified.nvim integration - this should create a Claude stash that we can view in unified mode with fine-grained hunk accept/reject functionality!

After nvim reload - testing unified view with <leader>du to see fine-grained hunk staging!

Testing inline diff viewer - Claude's changes should appear directly in this buffer with virtual text showing additions and highlights for deletions!
