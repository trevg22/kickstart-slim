HUNK TEST #4: test line modified by Claude

SEPARATED HUNK #3: This line should trigger inline diff automatically via hooks!

MANUAL HOOK TEST: This line was added after you ran pre_tool_use_hook!

AUTOMATIC HOOK TEST: This should trigger hooks automatically!

RESTART TEST: This edit is after Neovim restart - hooks should work now!

HOOKS FIXED: This edit should trigger the pre/post hooks and show inline diff!

TEST AFTER REBASE: This line should trigger the inline diff automatically!

HOOK TEST: Testing with corrected settings.json!

RESTART COMPLETE: Testing hooks after Neovim restart!

MANUAL HOOK TEST: Testing with manual hook execution!

DEBUG HOOK TEST: Testing if Claude Code calls the hook script!

POST-HOOK DEBUG: Testing with enhanced debugging!

FRESH NEOVIM: Testing inline diff after restart!

DEBUG LOGGING: Testing with detailed debug logging!

NOTIFICATION TEST: Testing with enhanced notifications after restart!

CLEAR LOG TEST: Testing after clearing debug log!

ESCAPE FIX: Testing with fixed escape sequence in settings.json!

SCOPE FIX: Testing with fixed baseline_ref scope!

INLINE DIFF TEST: Testing if inline diff finally works!

SCRIPT APPROACH: Testing with the hook script instead of hardcoded server!

HOOK EXECUTION TEST: Checking if Claude Code executes the hook script!

SIMPLE HOOK TEST: Testing with a very simple hook script!

VERBOSE HOOK TEST: Testing with detailed logging to debug hook execution!

TOUCH HOOK TEST: Testing with simplest possible hook that just touches a file!

PROPER HOOK TEST: Testing with a hook that follows Claude Code's expected format!

HOOKS WORKING: The hooks are executing! Let's see if inline diff appears!

DEBUG LOGS REMOVED: Testing inline diff without debug messages blocking execution!

WORKING INLINE DIFF: This edit should trigger the inline diff automatically!

FINAL TEST: With improved hook script - inline diff should appear now!

AUTOMATIC INLINE DIFF: This should appear automatically without any prompts!

NEW EDIT: This line is different from the baseline and should trigger inline diff!

RESTART TEST: Testing if inline diff works after Neovim restart!

BASELINE FIX TEST: This should properly update baseline when accepted!

DEBUG BASELINE: This edit includes debugging to see why baseline commits fail!

AFTER RESTART: Testing baseline commit creation with debug output!

BASELINE ISSUE: The pre-hook runs after edits, so baseline includes changes!

MULTI-EDIT TEST #3: Testing multiple hunks and navigation!

TEST EDIT #2: Checking consistency of diff display!

EDIT #2: Middle section replacement - this should be the second hunk!

MULTI-EDIT TEST #4: Testing hunk navigation with ]h and [h!

## INLINE DIFF SYSTEM V2
Our enhanced inline diff now uses git's histogram algorithm and proper stash-based baselines!

## TESTING HOOKS WITHOUT NOTIFICATIONS
The hooks now run silently without vim.notify interruptions!

EDIT #3: Bottom addition - this is the third hunk for testing!

EDIT 3: Final test line at the very bottom of the file!

ACCEPT TEST 4: Fourth and final hunk for testing!
