HOOKS FIXED: This edit should trigger the pre/post hooks and show inline diff!

TEST AFTER REBASE: This line should trigger the inline diff automatically!

HOOK TEST: Testing with corrected settings.json!

RESTART COMPLETE: Testing hooks after Neovim restart!

MANUAL HOOK TEST: Testing with manual hook execution!

DEBUG HOOK TEST: Testing if Claude Code calls the hook script!

POST-HOOK DEBUG: Testing with enhanced debugging!

FRESH NEOVIM: Testing inline diff after restart!

DEBUG LOGGING: Testing with detailed debug logging!

NOTIFICATION TEST: Testing with enhanced notifications after restart!

CLEAR LOG TEST: Testing after clearing debug log!

ESCAPE FIX: Testing with fixed escape sequence in settings.json!

SCOPE FIX: Testing with fixed baseline_ref scope!

TOUCH HOOK TEST: Testing with simplest possible hook that just touches a file!

PROPER HOOK TEST: Testing with a hook that follows Claude Code's expected format!

HOOKS WORKING: The hooks are executing! Let's see if inline diff appears!

DEBUG LOGS REMOVED: Testing inline diff without debug messages blocking execution!

WORKING INLINE DIFF: This edit should trigger the inline diff automatically!

FINAL TEST: With improved hook script - inline diff should appear now!

AUTOMATIC INLINE DIFF: This should appear automatically without any prompts!

NEW EDIT: This line is different from the baseline and should trigger inline diff!

RESTART TEST: Testing if inline diff works after Neovim restart!

BASELINE FIX TEST: This should properly update baseline when accepted!

DEBUG BASELINE: This edit includes debugging to see why baseline commits fail!

AFTER RESTART: Testing baseline commit creation with debug output!

BASELINE ISSUE: The pre-hook runs after edits, so baseline includes changes!

TEST EDIT #1: Testing if diffs appear consistently!

TEST EDIT #3: Third test - diffs should work every time!
