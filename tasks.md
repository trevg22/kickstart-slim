# Neovim Claude Integration - Task Tracking

## Project Overview

Building a Claude Code integration for Neovim that works seamlessly with a tmux-based workflow. The integration will support both interactive Claude sessions and autonomous "background agents" that can work on tasks independently.

## Core Principles

- **Tmux-first**: All Claude interactions happen in tmux panes/windows
- **Non-intrusive**: Doesn't change existing nvim/tmux workflow
- **Git-aware**: Leverages git worktrees for safe parallel development
- **Observable**: Easy to monitor what agents are doing

## Technical Decisions

### Git Strategy
- **Primary**: Git worktrees for speed and efficiency
- **Fallback**: Full clones for compatibility
- **Safety**: Never modify main working directory

### Tmux Integration
- Use `tmux send-keys` for Claude interaction
- Session/window naming for organization
- Preserve user's tmux workflow

### State Management
- Agent registry in `~/.local/share/nvim/claude-agents/`
- Per-project state in `.agent-work/.state/`
- JSON for serialization

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation (worktree â†’ clone)
- Clear error messages
- Recovery procedures for common issues

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Can spawn background agent in < 3 seconds
- [ ] Agent changes reviewable in < 5 keystrokes  
- [ ] Zero interference with normal nvim workflow
- [ ] Works on macOS and Linux
- [ ] Clear documentation for all features

## Next Steps

1. Review and refine task list
2. Set up development environment
3. Create plugin skeleton
4. Begin Phase 1 implementation

## Recent Accomplishments

### Inline Diff System (Major Feature)
- Complete implementation of inline diff visualization

## Background Agent Features (v1.0 Complete)

### Key Improvements
1. **Hook Isolation**: Background agents always run without hooks (no inline diffs)
2. **ClaudeSwitch**: Switch to agent's worktree to chat/give follow-ups (hooks remain disabled)
3. **ClaudeDiffAgent**: Review agent changes using diffview.nvim
4. **Progress Tracking**: Agents can update progress.txt for real-time status updates
5. **Statusline Integration**: Shows active agent count and latest progress
6. **Enhanced Agent Creation UI**: Interactive popup for mission description with fork options

### Usage
- `ClaudeBg` - Opens interactive UI for creating agents with:
  - Multi-line mission description editor
  - Fork options: current branch, main, stash, or any branch
  - Shows what the agent will be based on
- `ClaudeBg <task>` - Quick creation (backwards compatible)
- `ClaudeSwitch [agent]` - Switch to agent's worktree to chat (no inline diffs)
- `ClaudeDiffAgent [agent]` - Review agent changes with diffview
- `ClaudeAgents` - List all agents with progress
- Agents update progress: `echo 'status' > progress.txt`

### Agent Creation Options
- **Fork from current branch**: Default, uses your current branch state
- **Fork from default branch**: Start fresh from your default branch (auto-detects main/master)
- **Stash current changes**: Creates stash of current work, then applies to agent
- **Fork from other branch**: Choose any branch to base agent on

### Smart Branch Detection
The plugin automatically detects your repository's default branch (main, master, etc.) instead of assuming "main", making it compatible with older repositories that use "master".

### Design Philosophy
Background agents are kept simple - they're always background agents with hooks disabled. This avoids complexity around state transitions and keeps the workflow predictable. Use regular `:ClaudeChat` in your main workspace for inline diff functionality.
