# Neovim Claude Integration - Task Tracking

## Project Overview

Building a Claude Code integration for Neovim that works seamlessly with a tmux-based workflow. The integration will support both interactive Claude sessions and autonomous "background agents" that can work on tasks independently.

## Core Principles

- **Tmux-first**: All Claude interactions happen in tmux panes/windows
- **Non-intrusive**: Doesn't change existing nvim/tmux workflow
- **Git-aware**: Leverages git worktrees for safe parallel development
- **Observable**: Easy to monitor what agents are doing

## Feature Breakdown

### 1. Core Plugin Infrastructure

#### 1.1 Plugin Setup
- [x] Create plugin directory structure (`lua/nvim-claude/`)
- [x] Set up basic plugin module with `setup()` function
- [x] Add configuration options table
- [x] Create plugin entry in `lua/colinzhao/lazy/claude.lua`
- [x] Test: Plugin loads without errors

#### 1.2 Configuration Management
- [ ] Define default configuration schema
- [ ] Implement config validation
- [ ] Support user config overrides
- [ ] Add config options for:
  - [ ] Tmux pane split direction and size
  - [ ] Agent work directory name
  - [ ] Git worktree vs full clone preference
  - [ ] Auto-gitignore behavior
- [ ] Test: Config changes apply correctly

#### 1.3 Utility Functions
- [x] Create tmux interaction module

## Technical Decisions

### Git Strategy
- **Primary**: Git worktrees for speed and efficiency
- **Fallback**: Full clones for compatibility
- **Safety**: Never modify main working directory

### Tmux Integration
- Use `tmux send-keys` for Claude interaction
- Session/window naming for organization
- Preserve user's tmux workflow

### State Management
- Agent registry in `~/.local/share/nvim/claude-agents/`
- Per-project state in `.agent-work/.state/`
- JSON for serialization

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation (worktree â†’ clone)
- Clear error messages
- Recovery procedures for common issues

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Can spawn background agent in < 3 seconds
- [ ] Agent changes reviewable in < 5 keystrokes  
- [ ] Zero interference with normal nvim workflow
- [ ] Works on macOS and Linux
- [ ] Clear documentation for all features

## Next Steps

1. Review and refine task list
2. Set up development environment
3. Create plugin skeleton
4. Begin Phase 1 implementation
